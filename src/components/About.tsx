            BlueTech was born from a shared vision among a group of young developers who refused to be confined by outdated work models.
            We saw the rigid structures of traditional tech companies and knew there was another wayâ€”
            a way that embraces creativity, freedom, and innovation.
            We wanted to break free from the conventional, challenge the status quo, and redefine what it means to work in technology.
